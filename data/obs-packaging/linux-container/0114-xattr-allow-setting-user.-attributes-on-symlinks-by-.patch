Subject: [PATCH 114/114] xattr: allow setting user.* attributes on symlinks by
 owner

Kvmtool and clear containers supports using user attributes to label host
files with the virtual uid/guid of the file in the container. This allows an
end user to manage their files and a complete uid space without all the ugly
namespace stuff.

The one gap in the support is symlinks because an end user can change the
ownership of a symbolic link. We support attributes on these files as you
can already (as root) set security attributes on them.

The current rules seem slightly over-paranoid and as we have a use case this
patch enables updating the attributes on a symbolic link IFF you are the
owner of the synlink (as permissions are not usually meaningful on the link
itself).
